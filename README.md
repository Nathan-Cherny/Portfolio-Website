As of right now it's a work in progress but showcases 3 projects I felt demonstrate my broad range of coding abilties and mastery of several concepts.

The first project is "Ecosystem". This is a ecosystem simulation that simulates a marine life environment. Sharks eat fish, fish eats plants, and - most importantly - each animal has a set of genes. This includes things like speed, which determines if, for example, a fish can evade a shark trying to eat them or not depending on which animal has the highest speed stat. Overtime, natural selection occurs, and you can see that happening with the various graphs that are outputted as the simulation goes on. It's a really cool project and is the one that took the most time.

The second project is "nandCalculator.' If you know low level computer concepts, this project will make sense. I created a 32-bit calculator that can add and subtract 2 32-bit numbers - with only ONE logic gate - NAND. This is how real computers work, so by replicating it in javascript, it demonstrates my understanding of these circuits and mathematical computer concepts.

The third project is "Sudoku" that allows you to play a game of sudoku. I love sudoku and thought it would be a great way to show my algorithmic skills since I create the sudoku board from scratch every time you begin a new game. You can left click to place a number, right click to place a marker, and left click the numbers at the bottom to select which number you want to place down.

You can find the code for all of these projects (and the website itself) on this github page. I love computer science and have been coding ever since I can remember - literally. My goal is to succeed in the professional world as a software developer, doing what I love, working with other passionate programmers on a project that I genuinely think will positively impact the world. Help me achieve this goal by hiring me for internships, research, or what have you! I value any experience at all and will always be a great asset to your team. :)
